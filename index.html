    <h2>My Favorite Song - Warrior of the Mind</h2>
    <p>
      Background Information:<br />
      <br />
      Warrior Of The Mind is the fifth and final song of The Troy Saga where
      Athena reminds Odysseus that he must close off his heart and follow her
      teachings as he is the 'Warrior of The Mind'. The song also has a
      flashback to the past when Odysseus and Athena first met and she became
      his mentor.<br />

      Lyrics:<br />
      <br />
      [ATHENA]<br />
      Have you forgotten the lessons I taught you?<br />
      <br />
      [ODYSSEUS, spoken]<br />
      Athena<br />
      <br />
      [ATHENA]<br />
      Have you forgotten to turn off your heart? This is not you<br />
      I see you changing from how I've designed you<br />
      Have you forgotten your purpose? Let me remind you<br />
      Goddess of wisdom, master of war<br />
      My life has one mission, create the greatest warrior<br />
      <br />
      I had a challenge, a test of skill<br />
      A magic boar only the best could kill<br />
      One day a boy came for the thrill<br />
      A boy whose mind rivaled the boar's own will<br />
      <br />
      [ODYSSEUS, spoken]<br />
      Let's go!<br />
      <br />
      [ATHENA]<br />
      Maybe one day he'll follow me<br />
      And we'll make a greater tomorrow<br />
      Then they'll see I know he'll change the world<br />
      'Cause he is a warrior of the mind<br />
      Maybe one day I'll reach him<br />
      And we can build his skills as I teach him<br />
      If there's a problem, he'll have the answer<br />
      He is a warrior of the mind<br />

      How can you see through my spell?<br />

      Haha! I was lying and you fell for my bluff<br />
      Hahahaha<br />
      <br />
      [ATHENA]<br />
      Well done, enlighten me, what's your name?<br />
      <br />
      [ODYSSEUS]<br />
      You first, and maybe I'll do the same<br />
      <br />
      [ATHENA]<br />
      Nice try, but two can play this game<br />
      <br />

      Nah, don't be modest, I know you're a goddess<br />
      So let's be honest, you are Athena (Athena)<br />
      Badass in the arena<br />
      Unmatched, witty, and queen of<br />
      The best strategies we've seen<br />
      <br />

      [ATHENA]<br />
      If you're looking for a mentor<br />
      I'll make sure your time's well spent<br />
      <br />
      [ODYSSEUS]<br />
      Sounds like a plan, goddess and man, bestest of friends<br />
      <br />
      [ATHENA, spoken]<br />
      We'll see where it ends<br />
      <br />
      [ODYSSEUS, spoken]<br />
      Okay<br />
      <br />
      [ATHENA]<br />
      Maybe one day they'll follow me and we'll<br />
      <br />
      [ATHENA & ODYSSEUS]<br />
      Make a greater tomorrow<br />
      Then they'll see I know we'll change the world<br />
      'Cause we are the warriors of the mind<br />
      Maybe one day we'll reach them<br />
      And we can build their skills as we teach them<br />
      If there's a problem, we'll have the answer<br />
      We are the warriors of the mind<br />
      <br />
      [ATHENA]<br />
      I still intend to make sure you don't fall behind<br />
      Don't forget that you're a warrior of a very special kind<br />
      You are a warrior of the mind<br />
      Don't disappoint me<br />
